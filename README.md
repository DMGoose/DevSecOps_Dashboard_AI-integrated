# Universal DevSecOps Dashboard
This is a universal dashboard that allows you to visualize the scanning results of various security tools across multiple repositories.
It combines CI/CD integration, multi-tool vulnerability scanning, JSON report merging, and an interactive React + Node.js-based dashboard with AI-powered remediation suggestions.

## Features
-  **Automated security scanning** using CodeQL (SAST), Trivy (SCA), and OWASP ZAP (DAST)
-  **SARIF report parsing and merging** into a unified `merged-security-reports.json`
-  **React-based Dashboard** to visualize vulnerabilities by severity, tool, and component
-  **Dynamic GitHub repo selection**: users can load reports from any public GitHub repo
-  **AI integration** for remediation suggestions (Gemma4.0)
-  **Deployed on Vercel(frontend) & Render(backend)** for real-time report access
-  **Extensible** for additional tools or features (e.g., login, history, export)

## Workflow
**It requires a prerequisite workflow and an automation script**, which you can find in my [DVWA-T repo](https://github.com/DMGoose/DVWA-T):

**workflow**: `.github/workflows/workflow_intotal.yml` 

**automation script**: `scripts/parse_reports.py`


1. Triggered on push / PR / manual

2. Scans app with CodeQL, Trivy, and ZAP

3. Merges reports into a single JSON via parse_reports.py

4. Pushes report to /public/data/merged.json

5. Auto-deploys updated dashboard

6. Dashboard reads JSON dynamically based on user input

## How to View a Security Report
1. Open the deployed dashboard: https://dev-sec-ops-dashboard-ai-integrated.vercel.app/

2. Enter a GitHub repository name containing a merged-security-reports.json (You should use the `workflow_intotal.yml` to automatically generate this file)

3. Dashboard will fetch, visualize, and allow interactive exploration of vulnerabilities

**Note**: 
You might need to wait a bit for the backend to fetch AI suggestions :)

The UI is still a work in progress. 

The left sidebar currently contains placeholders â€” more features will be added soon.
