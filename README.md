## DashBoard-AI Integrated
This is a universal dashboard that allows you to visualize the scanning results of various security tools and generate tailored suggestions for each finding.
It requires a prerequisite workflow, which you can find in the DVWA-T repository:
`.github/workflows/workflow_intotal.yml`

**Note**: The UI is still a work in progress. The left sidebar currently contains placeholders â€” more features will be added soon.
